Building applications
---------------------

The files you will need for your application build are:

The four header files:
	_ptw32.h
	pthread.h
	semaphore.h
	sched.h

The DLL library files that you built:
	pthread*.dll
	plus the matching *.lib (MSVS) or *.a file (GNU)

or, the static link library that you built:
	pthread*.lib (MSVS) or libpthread*.a (GNU)

Place them in the appropriate directories for your build, which may be the
standard compiler locations or, locations specific to your project (you
might have a separate third-party dependency tree for example).
